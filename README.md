# VBA-Challenge
Homework #2

Created a VBA script to populate a table with unique ticker symbols their year start prices and year end prices along with year end total stock volumes.
The cell values can become quite long/large so please adjust the cell sizes accordingly otherwise the values returned are not the true values
Instead they are rounded to fit into the smaller cell sizes. Hopefully this does everything asked for, see ya later VBA!
